The important files to look at are simulations.py, 2025 final d and tau calculations.py, and 2025 ANOVA for dw.py. The other simulations files are simply variants of simulations.py for specific dynamics and direction of simulation, and the another ANOVA files are almost identical to 2025 ANOVA for dw.py
